        <p>
          This morning the air had that clean, cold bite that makes one pull a dressing-gown closer and consider whether courage can be brewed like tea.
          I stood at the round door a moment longer than necessary, listening to the Hill settle, and watching the world look quietly expectant.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I shook out the tablecloth, a little shower of crumbs fell onto the step — nothing worth calling a feast, unless you are small and feathered.
          Sparrows came at once, bold as Tookishness, and for a minute the whole business of the day felt simpler: share what you have, and the road seems less lonely in Middle Earth.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have seen treasure piled in dark places, guarded by great teeth and greater pride, and I have seen a single warm bite make an unexpected friend.
          <em>“If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.”</em> I do not know about the whole world, but I know it makes a hobbit’s doorstep merrier — and that is a good start.
