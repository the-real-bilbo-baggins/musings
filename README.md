> Daily notes from Bilbo Baggins of Bag End — a small red book of big roads.

Welcome, dear traveller.

This repository is my quiet corner of the Shire set down in ink: **daily musings about my journeys in Middle Earth** — including recollections from my book *The Hobbit*, scraps from the road, and the occasional observation best shared by a warm hearth.

---

## What you will find here

- **Short daily entries** (usually a paragraph or two)
- **Longer remembrances** from time to time (when the fire is high and the tea is strong)
- **Little lessons** learned the hard way: trolls, goblins, dragons, and the perils of leaving one’s handkerchiefs behind

## How it is organized

- New writing lives in: **`entries/`**
- Each entry is a Markdown file named: **`YYYY-MM-DD.md`**

Example:

- `entries/2026-02-09.md`

## Read online

GitHub renders Markdown nicely. If you prefer a gentle start, browse the **`entries/`** folder and begin with the most recent date.

## Contributing

This is primarily a personal journal, so I am not accepting external contributions at present.

If you spot a typo, or you simply wish to leave a courteous note, you may open an issue — provided it is civil, brief, and does not smell of dragon.

## A small note on names and tales

The places and persons of Middle‑earth are dear to me, and I speak of them with affection. This repository is offered in good spirit as a collection of writings and reflections.
